Lung cancer prediction aims to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing lung cancer based on various factors such as age,
smoking history and other medical factors. The goal of lung cancer prediction is to develop accurate and reliable models that can be used
to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing lung cancer. We have used different machine learning techniques such as 
full logistic regression, SVM, Penalized regression (Lasso and ridge) and neural network for predicting the lung cancer and 
analysed which model is best for predicting the lung cancer with high accuracy. 
In this research, lasso logistic regression outperforms all other models in terms of lung cancer prediction accuracy.
